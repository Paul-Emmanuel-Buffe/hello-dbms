# Hello DBMS+

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive study of database management systems, SQL querying techniques, and their practical application through a carbon footprint calculator web application. The project demonstrates proficiency in relational database design, complex SQL operations, and data-driven web development using Flask.

## Context

With global data generation projected to exceed 180 zettabytes by 2025, representing a 30-fold increase from 2010, effective data management has become critical for modern organizations. This project explores the foundational concepts and practical skills required to design, query, and leverage relational databases for real-world applications.

## Learning Objectives

This project addresses the following competencies:

- Database management system architecture and design
- SQL query development and optimization
- Data quality assessment and validation
- ETL processes and automated data collection
- GDPR-compliant data collection methodologies
- Web application development with Flask
- Exploratory data analysis techniques

## Technical Research

The repository includes comprehensive research documentation covering:

- Data definitions, formats, and quality metrics
- Comparative analysis of Data Lakes, Data Warehouses, and Lake Houses
- Relational vs non-relational database systems with use cases
- Database design methodologies including Merise and UML
- ACID properties and their importance in transaction management
- Primary and foreign key concepts
- SQL fundamentals including joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions

## Implementation Components

### SQL Query Development

Nine progressive SQL exercises demonstrating:

- Fundamental SELECT operations with filtering and sorting
- Pattern matching using LIKE operators and wildcards
- Aggregate functions for statistical analysis
- Multi-table joins with complex relationships
- Subquery implementation for comparative analysis
- Database and table creation with proper constraints
- Exploratory data analysis on real-world datasets

### Carbon Footprint Calculator Application

A Flask-based web application designed to:

- Calculate CO2 emissions from electricity production by country
- Analyze energy source composition and environmental impact
- Provide interactive data visualization and filtering
- Calculate tree planting requirements for carbon offset
- Present actionable insights on energy sustainability

The application uses 2015 global electricity production data and IPCC emission factors to compute carbon footprints based on energy mix composition across different countries and regions.

## Technologies

- SQL for database querying and management
- Python for application logic and data processing
- Flask for web framework
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- HTML/CSS for frontend presentation
